## D-001 — Target deployment is mainnet while the programme is specified testnet-only

- **Severity:** Blocker
- **Status:** Open
- **Affects:** EV-01, EV-02, EV-03, EV-04

**Steps to reproduce**

```
curl -s https://orizons.xyz/api/stellar/network
```

**Expected** — `"network": "testnet"`, matching the QA task's "Week 1 (M1) ·
testnet only" scope and its `--api-base https://orizons.xyz` verification
command.

**Actual**

```json
"network": "mainnet",
"rpc_url": "https://mainnet.sorobanrpc.com",
"network_passphrase": "Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015"
```

The four contract ids returned are the mainnet deployment.

**Impact** — The registration evidence journey requires signing a real
registration. On this target that is a live mainnet transaction spending real
XLM against non-upgradable contracts. No test may execute it, so EV-01 through
EV-04 cannot be exercised end to end and are recorded Blocked rather than
Failed.

**Resolution path** — Point `UAT_BASE_URL` at a deployment whose
`/api/stellar/network` reports testnet, then re-run the EV suite. The suite
reads the expected network from `UAT_EXPECTED_NETWORK` rather than hardcoding
it, so no test change is needed when the target flips.
