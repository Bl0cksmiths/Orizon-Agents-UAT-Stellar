# UAT defects

Severity definitions are in `test-plan.md`.

---

## D-001 — Target deployment is mainnet while the programme is specified testnet-only

- **Severity:** Blocker
- **Status:** Open
- **Affects:** EV-01, EV-02, EV-03, EV-04

**Steps to reproduce**

```
curl -s https://orizons.xyz/api/stellar/network
```

**Expected** — `"network": "testnet"`, matching the QA task's "Week 1 (M1) ·
testnet only" scope and its `--api-base https://orizons.xyz` verification
command.

**Actual**

```json
"network": "mainnet",
"rpc_url": "https://mainnet.sorobanrpc.com",
"network_passphrase": "Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015"
```

The four contract ids returned are the mainnet deployment.

**Impact** — The registration evidence journey requires signing a real
registration. On this target that is a live mainnet transaction spending real
XLM against non-upgradable contracts. No test may execute it, so EV-01 through
EV-04 cannot be exercised end to end and are recorded Blocked rather than
Failed.

**Resolution path** — Point `UAT_BASE_URL` at a deployment whose
`/api/stellar/network` reports testnet, then re-run the EV suite. The suite
reads the expected network from `UAT_EXPECTED_NETWORK` rather than hardcoding
it, so no test change is needed when the target flips.

## D-002 — Cannot install dependencies or execute any test on the authoring machine

- **Severity:** Blocker (process, not product)
- **Status:** Open
- **Affects:** the verification step of every criterion

**Steps to reproduce** — Run `npm ci` in this repo on the authoring machine.

**Expected** — Dependencies install; `npm test` runs.

**Actual** — Three attempts, three failures: two OOM kills (at 689 and 230
packages) and one `ENOTEMPTY` file lock on `node_modules/next/compat`. The
machine reports 3.83 GB total RAM with 0.35–0.78 GB free. A subsequent
recursive delete of `node_modules` also failed.

**Impact** — No commit in this programme has been runtime-verified. Every
commit was checked statically only: brace balance, import resolution, and a
line-for-line diff against the authored source. That static pass did catch a
real defect (two spec files silently truncated during chunked commits), but it
cannot catch a wrong selector or a failing assertion.

**Resolution path** — Either free memory on the authoring machine (pausing
real-time antivirus is the highest-value single step; the failed delete and the
install slowness both point at it), or add `workflow` scope to the GitHub token
so CI becomes the verifier. See D-003.

---

## D-003 — CI cannot run: the GitHub token lacks `workflow` scope

- **Severity:** Critical
- **Status:** Open
- **Affects:** the "CI green on uat" exit criterion

**Steps to reproduce** — Commit a file under `.github/workflows/` and push.

**Actual**

```
! [remote rejected] refusing to allow a Personal Access Token to create or
  update workflow `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` without `workflow` scope
```

**Impact** — The suite has no automated runner. The workflow is complete but
parked at `ci/e2e.workflow.yml`, where GitHub ignores it. Combined with D-002,
nothing in this programme has executed anywhere.

**Resolution path** — Add `workflow` scope to the token, then
`git mv ci/e2e.workflow.yml .github/workflows/e2e.yml`. The workflow already
covers three browser projects, a backend warm-up step, and report artifacts.
